## The name of the docker network that containers will be attached to.
## If you want to proxy Packit to the host, you will need to
## arrange a proxy on this network, or use dev_mode in the web section
## below.
## Prefix for container names; we'll use {container_prefix}-(container_name)
container_prefix: packit

## Set this flag to true to prevent use of --volumes in the cli to remove
## volumes on stop
protect_data: false

## Docker org for images
repo: mrcide

## The name of the docker network that containers will be attached to.
## If you want to proxy Packit to the host, you will need to
## arrange a proxy on this network
network: packit-network

## Names of the docker volumes to use:
##
## outpack: stores the outpack metadata
## proxy_logs: stores logs from the reverse proxy (only used if proxy is given)
## (More volumes are anticipated as the tool develops)
volumes:
  outpack: outpack_volume
  proxy_logs: packit_proxy_logs
  orderly_library: orderly_library
  orderly_logs: orderly_logs

## Path to ssh key for interacting with git. You
## might use a github deploy key here. For completeness both the
## public and private parts of the keypair are listed.
ssh:
  public: VAULT:secret/ssh:public
  private: VAULT:secret/ssh:private

outpack:
  ## Initialise an outpack directory by cloning from github
  initial:
    ##  If using a private repo, then use an ssh url and provide ssh keys in the
    ## "ssh" section above.

orderly-runner:
  # The image for the runner; this is going to be a trick because the
  # image needs to contain at least the runner itself (a container
  # that we create that contains the packages required to actually run
  # the queue) and the packages that the user needs to run their
  # reports.  The latter we might change to use a volume later, which
  # has the advantage of all runners definitely seeing the same data,
  # even in the case where we update/change/install packages without
  # redeploying.

  # Custom logo image (any format). Should be in the same dir as this config file.
  # With regards to size/dimensions, the logo will be constrained to the height of the header, and the proportions between height and width are maintained.

  css: # Optional custom CSS variables. If dark variants are not provided, light variants will be used in dark mode.
